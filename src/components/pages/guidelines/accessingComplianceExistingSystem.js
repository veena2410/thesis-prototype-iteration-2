      <h2>Guidelines For Accessing Compliance Of Existing iHFeMS</h2>

      <p>It is undeniable fact that there are efforts to computerize various clinical and
                                    administrative functions
                                    noticeable in some health facilities in the country. While there is significant
                                    improvement in management
                                    of health resources and service provision in those facilities, the degree of success
                                    on these automations
                                    varies significantly, with some obtaining suboptimal results. In order to ensure
                                    that Health facility
                                    accrue maximum benefits from the existing systems and be able to address issues of
                                    standards and data
                                    exchange, a number of activities need to be carried out by the respective
                                    facilities. This will ensure that
                                    the existing systems become compliant with the national iHFeMS standards and
                                    guidelines.</p>
