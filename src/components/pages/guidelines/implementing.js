      <h2>Implementing The iHFeMS: Guidelines</h2>

      <p>Part C presents the minimum requirements and standards that the iHFeMS must meet to
                                    ensure
                                    that it create the value and the utility to its stakeholders. However, meeting the
                                    above-mentioned
                                    requirements alone does not guarantee successful implementation and use of the
                                    iHFeMS in a Health
                                    facility. Therefore in this part we provide a set of guidelines to ensure successful
                                    implementation and
                                    use of the iHFeMS.
                                    <br></br>
                                    Activities related to the implementation and use of iHFeMS in a Health facility can
                                    be grouped into
                                    three main phases. They are planning, deployment, and maintenance and support. In
                                    the following
                                    sections, a set of activities and guidelines is presented for each of the phases.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Phase 1: Planning </h3>

<b>Description</b>
<p>The implementation of the iHFeMS requires careful planning to ensure that the
    implementation
    proceeds in comprehensive, cost-effective and timely ways. This involves a range of
    activities including
    establishment of the governance structure, budgeting, development of the
    implementation work plan,
    acquiring the iHFeMS software, readiness assessment and procurement of the required
    computing
    infrastructure.</p>

<b>Objective</b>
<p>To ensure adequate allocation of resources for successful iHFeMS implementation</p>

<b>Scope</b>
<p>All iHFeMS implementation activities in the health facility shall be subjected to a
    formal business
    planning process.</p>

<b>Standard Guidelines</b>
<br></br>

<h4>Establishing iHFeMS Governance</h4>
<p>The Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry Of Health, Community Development,
    Gender, Elderly
    and Children should be the Executive Sponsor of the iHFeMS implementation Project.
    The overall
    oversight of this initiative should be led by the National eHealth Steering
    Committee. Key project
    decisions and go-ahead approvals should be presented to the group.
    <br></br>The iHFeMS implementation should be led by the Head ICT at Ministry of
    Health, Community
    Development, Gender, Elderly and Children who is the current Champion of the project
    on behalf
    of the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children. The
    iHFeMS
    champion should be supported by the NeHSC to ensure the attainment of established
    objectives. The
    NeHSC should be supported by PO-RALG and Health facility iHFeMS implementation Lead,
    at the Health facility level as local supervisor. The Health facility level lead
    should be the primary link
    between the Health facility iHFeMS steering committee and NeHSC.
    <br></br>
    The overall oversight of the initiative at the Health facility level should be led
    by the Health facility
    iHFeMS Steering Committee. Key project decisions and go-ahead approvals should be
    presented to
    the group. The health facility in-charge shall be the chairperson for regional and
    district Health facility
    steering committees. Quarterly updates should be provided to National eHealth
    Steering Committee
    and the Permanent Secretary (PS) in the Ministry of Health, Community Development,
    Gender,
    Elderly and Children who is the Executive Sponsor of this initiative.
</p>

</p>

<h4>Budgeting</h4>
<p>Implementation of iHFeMS is a complex and challenging task. One obstacle to
    successful
    implementation can be the cost of converting to an electronic system when
    insufficient health care
    funding has been budgeted. It is essential that Health facility management and
    stakeholders involved in
    planning for iHFeMS implementation understand what funding is available and develop
    a timeframe
    for funding in conjunction with timetables for implementation.
    <br></br>The high cost of the software and computers means that the initial costs
    associated with the introduction
    of an iHFeMS are significant, both in terms of time and finance. However, the
    ongoing costs of
    running an iHFeMS as well as longer-term issues of maintenance and support are
    significant as well.</p>

    <h4>Payment Modalities</h4>
    <p>
                                    TCO is a financial estimate of both the monetary impact and human resource impact of
                                    acquiring,
                                    deploying, and retiring an information technology system over the life cycle of the
                                    product. It is
                                    comprised of a number of factors that can be categorised as: Acquisition (one time)
                                    expenses and
                                    Operational (ongoing) expenses.
                                    <br></br>
                                    Public Health Facilities must adhere to the following payment modalities for Total
                                    cost of Ownership
                                    (TCO):
                                    <br></br>
                                    SG1. There must be mutual agreement between the health facility owner and the
                                    service provider on
                                    the TCO payment mode, either through one time or installment. The TCO must be
                                    jointly
                                    established using the following criteria/parameters.
                                    <br></br>
                                    SG2. Incase of Payment by installment the amount and both parties must mutually
                                    agree with
                                    timeframe.
                                    <br></br>
                                    SG3. Any commission paid to the vendor from revenue collections must be the payment,
                                    which compensates the cost incurred by the vendor during the implementation and/or
                                    operationalization of the system.
                                    <br></br>
                                    SG4. Public health facilities must enter into agreement with one of the Government
                                    pre-qualified
                                    service providers who have been approved by the National eHealth Steering Committee
                                    (NeHSC).
                                    </p>


                                    <h4>Implementation Work Plan</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The implementation of the iHFeMS requires a well-established work plan. Therefore
                                    prior to
                                    commencing any activity, public Health facility must seek advice to Ministry of
                                    Health, Community
                                    Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, eGovernment Agency (eGA), through PO-RALG
                                    on
                                    how to create the implementation work plan, and inform NeHSC at Ministry of Health,
                                    Community
                                    Development, Gender, Elderly and Children for approval. The work plan should
                                    explicitly state:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Activity of the project</li>
                                    <li>Effort needed for each activity</li>
                                    <li>Dependencies of each activity</li>
                                    <li>Deliverables and milestones</li>
                                    <li>Resources assigned</li>
                                    <li>A template of the implementation work plan is provided in Appendix A.</li>
                                </ul>

                                </p>


                                <h4>Acquiring the iHFeMS</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Before implementing the iHFeMS in a health facility, Health facility management has
                                    to decide how
                                    to acquire the software for implementation. There are two possible options to obtain
                                    the right software
                                    for the Health facility. There are two types:

                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Make and Build from scratch or customization of an existing software</b>
                                        Options for acquiring software at a facility are either in-house or outsourced
                                        development of
                                        the system or customization of existing software from a vendor or free and open
                                        source system
                                        market. The ministry or individual Health facility may consider using public
                                        private partnership
                                        (PPP) to acquire an iHFeMS through Build–operate–transfer (BOT)
                                        project-financing form.
                                        Customized software is an alternative, which will deliver value to a Health
                                        facility in providing
                                        software, which meets exact requirements as defined during analysis and
                                        specifications.
                                    </li>

                                    <li><b>Purchasing an existing software (Commercial-off-the-shelf software)</b>
                                        Another possible option to acquiring the software at a facility is to buy
                                        existing software from
                                        a vendor. This option is further divided into two alternatives.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Purchase software as a product in which a Health facility purchases and
                                                host it and
                                                managing itself while paying for annual license and maintenance fees.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Purchase software as service from a vendor who will be responsible for
                                                deployment,
                                                implementation and maintenance while a Health facility will be paying
                                                fees for the
                                                service provided by the vendor. The vendor will have sole ownership of
                                                the system.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                    </li>

                                </ul>

                                There are several factors to consider when buying the software, however one of the main
                                factor is the
                                Total cost of ownership (TCO). The overall goal is to select technology that minimizes
                                TCO while
                                meeting minimum functional and operational standards. Other challenges which should be
                                critically
                                analysed in order avoid them from occurring include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Dependency on the software vendor which sometimes leads to vendor lock in</li>
                                    <li>Incompatibilities from future modifications or upgrades of other systems</li>
                                    <li>Difficulty in integration with other systems</li>
                                    <li>Security issues</li>
                                </ul>

                                When evaluating the total cost of ownership (TCO), the following factors are to be
                                considered:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Acquisition Expenses</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Software licensing (for the Public Health facilities must opt for Open
                                            source software)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Hardware (server, client workstations, mobile devices)</li>
                                        <li>Infrastructure (networking hardware and software)</li>
                                        <li>Technical support for installation and configuration costs</li>
                                        <li>Initial training costs</li>

                                    </ul>

                                    <li>Operational (Ongoing) expenses</li>
                                    <ul>

                                    The following quality standards should be considered for iHFeMS and the computing
                                    infrastructure
                                    equipment.
                                    <br></br>
                                    P1. Prior to iHFeMS or any other software is acquired, there must be a formalized
                                    requirements
                                    specification document prepared based on the national iHFeMS standards and that will
                                    be
                                    signed off and approved.
                                    <br></br>
                                    P2. All off-the-shelf software identified for acquisition should satisfy the

                                    <br></br>
                                    P3. It is highly recommended that vendors for off-the-shelf software should have
                                    implemented the
                                    software in at least one similar facility successfully and the reference should be
                                    verifiable.
                                    <br></br>
                                    P4. The vendor should be able to offer support of the iHFeMS software post
                                    implementation.
                                    <br></br>
                                    P5. Capacity building plan should be developed and approved in the acquisition
                                    process to ensure
                                    that internal staffs are capacitated to support the iHFeMS
                                    <br></br>
                                    P6. For all acquired hardware there must be requirements specified by the user
                                    department which
                                    will be signed off and approved
                                    <br></br>
                                    P7. All software and computing infrastructure equipment should have a warranty for a
                                    specified
                                    period of not less than 1 year

                                    User documentation is needed by system end users and should be written in simple,
                                    user-friendly
                                    language. User documentation should include electronic context sensitive help and
                                    printable training
                                    manuals. This document provides a step-by-step guide on iHFeMS system
                                    functionalities and
                                    instructions on how to use the system. It should cover how to run the system, how to
                                    enter data, how
                                    to modify data and how to save and print reports. It should include a list of error
                                    messages and advice
                                    on what to do if something goes wrong.

                                    <br></br>
                                    System testing is an important step when rolling out any software. Before the system
                                    is put into
                                    production, the key stakeholders must perform acceptance testing to get the buy-off
                                    of the functionality.
                                    This should be done after every release of the system.

                                    Health facility. Users must be trained prior to iHFeMS implementation. Successful
                                    implementation
                                    will only occur if users like the system and commit to use it. Users need to
                                    understand what benefit
                                    the new system has for them, why they should use this new system, and how it is
                                    going to make their
                                    jobs easier. The Health facility management needs to understand how it is going to
                                    make them and
                                    their Health facility look better.

                                    been trained,
                                    Health facility should run a limited trial-run of the iHFeMS in parallel to any
                                    previous system (paper
                                    or otherwise) to allow users to test their knowledge in using the system and make
                                    sure they full
                                    understand how to perform their job with the new system in place. At the end of the
                                    trial-run, the
                                    trial-run must be assessed to determine whether the Health facility is ready to go
                                    to production use of
                                    the new system. The assessment should be guided by a well define Trial-run to
                                    Production Readiness
                                    Assessment Tool (see Appendix D).</p>

                                <h4>Trial-run to Production</h4>
                                <p>Once the Health facility has passed the readiness assessment during the trial-run,
                                    the system should be
                                    moved into production.</p>

                                <p>Maintenance and support of the iHFeMS operations is an essential ingredient in making
                                    its adoption
                                    successful and thus achieve the intended organizational goals. Maintenance aims at
                                    retaining the
                                    system in the working state; with support of the ICT Team to enable users achieve
                                    their objectives.
                                    Furthermore maintenance includes both preventive and incidental maintenance.

                                controlled according to formal change management procedures. This section contains the Standard
                                guidelines.<br></br>

                                SG1 Change Initiation: All system changes shall be initiated by filling in the change control form,
                                which will be signed by the respective heads of department, and addressed to the ICT department.
                                <br></br>SG2 Change Authorization: Authorization for any changes, whether urgent or not, shall be given
                                by the head of the ICT department if satisfied that the reason for the change is sound and that
                                there is no adverse effect as a result of the change.
                                <br></br>SG3 Testing of changes: All testing shall be done from a test environment. No change will be
                                applied to the live/production environment without having been tested in the test environment.
                                <br></br>SG4 Change approval: The concerned user departments shall check the system to see whether the
                                results produced are as expected and a user acceptance testing (UAT) form shall be signed off.
                                <br></br>SG5 Change Scheduling: To minimize disruption to the normal working operations of the Health
                                facility, no changes shall be effected in the system during normal working hours unless absolutely
                                necessary. All changes will be scheduled during weekends, public holidays or after business
                                working hours.
                                <br></br>SG6 Change Communication: All planned system changes shall be communicated in advance to
                                the concerned parties to minimize on business disruption and inconveniences. For avoidance
                                of doubt, no scheduled system change should be effected in the live iHFeMS during a busy
                                business cycle.
                                <br></br>SG7 Change Recovery, Safety measures: Before effecting any change in the production environment,
                                a backup on a clearly labelled storage media shall be taken and kept for good. In the event that
                                the change made produces unexpected results, the backup taken before the change was effected
                                has to be used to restore the system to the point before the change.
                                <br></br>SG8 Change Documentation and tracking:  All system changes, whether approved or not shall
                                be documented and filed. The documentation shall include a duly completed and signed off
                                “change request form”, the test results and any other comments/documents used.
