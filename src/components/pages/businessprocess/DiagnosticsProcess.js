            <h1>Dianostics Process</h1>

            <p>Diagnostics services (laboratory and radiology) have an important role in the provision of health
                                                    care services. The activities of the laboratory process include: receiving test orders from clinicians,
                                                    specimen collection, specimen identification, preparation and transport, analysis, result reporting and
                                                    interpretation. The activities of the radiology process include: receiving patient who need a test,
                                                    perform the test, analysis, result reporting and interpretation.</p>

                                                <h3>Standard Guidelines for process improvement</h3>
                                                SG1. The laboratory and radiology machines should be integrated with iHFeMS such that only
                                                already billed or paid for samples and tests appear on the machine software for testing. This
                                                ensures that Laboratory technicians attend to the only billed or paid for samples and tests. The
                                                integration will remove the loopholes and increase revenue to the Health facility.
                                                <br></br>
                                                SG2. The laboratory/radiology technician should be given an option in the iHFeMS to disable
                                                temporarily all the tests, which may not be available due to reasons such as no reagents, machines
                                                out of order or under maintenance. This will alert the revenue clerk through warning messages.
                                                <br></br>
                                                SG3. Mechanism should enable Clinician to track progress status of samples/investigations sent to the
                                                laboratory or radiology section.

                                                In order to improve laboratory process the following procedures should followed:-
                                                <br></br>
                                                P1. Order /sample booking. The order booking process begins with a request for investigations by
