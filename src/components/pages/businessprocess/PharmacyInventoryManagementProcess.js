            <h1>Pharmacy and Inventory Management Process </h1>

            <p>In Health facility settings stores and inventory are commonly categorized into general and pharmacy
                                                    store. The activities performed at the pharmacy store include acquisition, control, management, tracking
                                                    and dispensing of medicine and medical supplies. Whereas the activities related to the general store
                                                    involves acquisition, control, management, and tracking of non-medical goods. While both stores are
                                                    very important, this guideline document focused on the analysis and improvement of pharmacy store.
                                                    <br></br>This is because the pharmacy store is an essential and extensively used facility in the Health facility
                                                    and in the health sector in general. It caters to outpatients, inpatients, and other treatment areas like
                                                    operation theatre and clinical laboratory. Therefore the pharmacy store must efficiently be managed
                                                    and organized to meet patient medication needs and comply with applicable laws and regulations and
                                                    control medications throughout the Health facility.</p>

                                                    can be grouped into three main business processes: (i) Central inventory management process which
                                                    includes activities ranging from requisition of medical supplies from MSD and other suppliers,
                                                    receiving, storage, and management (ii) Distribution process which includes activities for receiving

                                                    activities for delivering medicine to a patient. The process and the descriptions of the activities that
                                                    reflect recommended improvements are discussed.
