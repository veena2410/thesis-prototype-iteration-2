            <h1>Scheduling Appointment</h1>

            <p>The appointment scheduling process allows health worker to make patient appointment with preferred
                                                    date and time to obviate the necessity to sit in queues and wait for consultation. The patient contacts
                                                    the Health facility by agreed means of communication; say by telephone, personal contact, email etc.,
                                                    and books an advance appointment with the choice doctor/department on a given date and given
                                                    slot of time. The consulting doctor also would have the idea of the load on a given day in the Health
                                                    facility. Having a different person scheduling the next appointment date for follow up patients may
                                                    distort the planned treatment of the doctor. Medical records of the patients visiting the Health facility
                                                    will have to be maintained and updated. Hence the file is handled to and from the consulting room
                                                    and the medical records Department.</p>

                                                <p>SG1. A doctor through the iHFeMS must make proper decision of the required dates for the requested
                                                appointment.
