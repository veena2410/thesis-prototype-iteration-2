            <p>The distribution process is triggered by a requisition. Individual requisitions can be received from
                                                    service delivery locations when a “pull” system has been implemented or in the case of a “push” system

                                                    Allocation of stock for a requisition can depend on stock status within the store, competing needs of
                                                    other service delivery, consumption patterns, or budgetary status. Refer Figure 5.</p>
