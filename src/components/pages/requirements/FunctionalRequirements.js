      <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>

      <p>Functional requirements capture the intended behavior of the iHFeMS expressed as services, tasks or
                                    functions the system is required to perform. There are various techniques that will help you to indicate
                                    the level of priority of each system requirement. We have chosen to address the minimum requirement
                                    that must be incorporated in each iHFeMS with a word <i>Must</i> to indicate a <i>Mandatory</i> priority.</p>
                                <br></br>
